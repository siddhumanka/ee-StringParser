Despite the distractions, Olympic organizers were focused on what made the Games in Rio memorable.
"These were and still are iconic Olympic Games in many respects," IOC President Thomas Bach told journalists in Rio on Saturday.
"We have seen iconic athletes across all the sports. We have seen athletes who were icons already when they came here and they even strengthened their positions as icons like Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt, and we have seen athletes who have become icons here."
Bach said the level of competition was "extremely high" with "stunning" athlete performances.
"I can only congratulate these athletes and say thank you, because this is really the spirit of the Olympic Games."

Phelps could be an example for teammate Lochte about how to bounce back from struggle.
Now the most decorated Olympian ever, Phelps was caught driving under the influence in 2004. He was found guilty and sentenced to 18 months of probation for what was his first DUI arrest.
USA Swimming suspended the 25-time Olympic medalist for 6 months for his second DUI arrest, in 2014, and he wasn't allowed to compete for the US at the world championships in 2015.
Phelps initially lost sponsors, but went on to win new ones after going to rehab and showing remorse.
USA Swimming suspended swimmer Troy Dalbey after an incident at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, in which he and a teammate took an $800 marble lion's head statue from a hotel.
Like Lochte, Dalbey was harshly criticized after he apologized publicly for the prank.
No charges were filed, but the swimmers were dropped from the squad and sent home. The national swimming governing body suspended Dalbey from national and international competition and team training camps for 18 months.
